## **üéõ UI/UX Design**
### **Displays & Feedback System**
| **Display Type** | **Purpose** | **Notes** |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **TFT Display** | Main status display (altitude, velocity, SAS mode, camera mode, etc.) | Chosen for high-resolution graphical feedback |
| **OLED Display (Throttle)** | Shows throttle mode, current throttle percentage, and in-game throttle level | Compact & high-contrast |
| **OLED Display (Menu)** | Used for profile selection, calibration, settings | Menu navigation via rotary encoder |
| **RGB-Lit Buttons** | Indicate status of landing gear, brakes, RCS, SAS, stage lock | Provides immediate visual feedback |
| **RGB-Lit Rotary Encoders** | Used for SAS mode and camera mode selection | Blinks briefly when a mode is switched |

### **Controls**
| **Control** | **Function** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **2x Joysticks (JH-D400X-R4)** | **Translation (X, Y, Z) & Rotation (Pitch, Yaw, Roll)** | One for translation, one for rotation |
| **Linear Potentiometer (Throttle)** | **Primary throttle control** | Motorized for self-calibration & auto-throttle |
| **Spring-Loaded Slider (Fore/Aft Translation)** | **Allows forward/backward movement in space** | Returns to center when released |
| **Rotary Encoder (Camera Mode)** | Cycles through camera views | Click toggles Free Camera |
| **Rotary Encoder (SAS Mode)** | Changes SAS mode | RGB-lit for mode indication |
| **20x Action Group Buttons** | Used for custom game functions | Split into 2x10 layout |
| **Precision Control Mode Button** | Enables fine-tuned movement (Caps Lock in KSP) | LED-lit for status indication |
| **Stage Button & Stage Lock Button (LED-lit)** | Executes staging and prevents accidental staging | Stage lock LED indicates status |

## **‚ö° Power System**
### **Primary Power: USB-C PD (5V, up to 3A)**
- Powers **Teensy 4.1, displays, joysticks, buttons, encoders**
- Uses **a high-efficiency voltage regulator** to prevent power fluctuations

### **Secondary Power Options:**
| **Power Source** | **Implementation Method** | **Status** |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Second USB-C (Power Only)** | Dedicated power input via USB-PD | **Optional footprint on PCB** |
| **PoE (Power over Ethernet)** | UCTRONICS PoE Splitter (5V 4A) | **Planned, splitter mounted internally** |
| **AC-DC PSU (IEC C7/C8)** | Internal power supply conversion | **Rejected (too complex for current build)** |

### **Power Stabilization Measures:**
- **Large capacitor (470¬µF - 1000¬µF) to smooth out motor power spikes**
- **Power monitoring circuit with menu-based logging**

## **üñ• Microcontroller & Hardware Integration**
### **Main Microcontroller: Teensy 4.1**
- **Chosen for its high-speed processing & USB-HID support**
- Supports **Ethernet connectivity for mod integration**
- Handles all **sensor inputs, controls, display updates**

### **Additional Components:**
| **Component** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Motorized Potentiometer** | Allows automatic throttle calibration & autothrottle |
| **H-Bridge Motor Driver** | Controls motorized throttle |
| **Ethernet Kit for Teensy 4.1** | Adds network support for integration with KSP mods |
| **RGB Controllers** | For LED feedback systems |
| **Custom PCB (Planned)** | Houses main connections for switches, encoders, LEDs |

## **üìå Appendix: SAS Mode Selection Considerations**
### **Debating Between RGB Buttons vs. Rotary Encoder for SAS Mode**
Currently undecided between two options:
- **8 RGB-Lit Buttons (2x4 Layout)** for direct SAS mode switching.
- **RGB-Lit Rotary Encoder** for cycling through SAS modes sequentially.

#### **Pros of RGB Buttons**
‚úî **Faster switching** ‚Äì Instant access to any mode.  
‚úî **Clearer visual feedback** ‚Äì Each button can light up for active mode.  
‚úî **Better for other game profiles** ‚Äì Buttons can be reassigned in different USB-HID profiles.  

#### **Cons of RGB Buttons**
‚ùå **More space required** ‚Äì Takes up significant panel space.  
‚ùå **Higher wiring complexity** ‚Äì Each button needs dedicated connections or a button matrix.  

#### **Pros of Rotary Encoder**
‚úî **Compact design** ‚Äì Takes up less space than buttons.  
‚úî **Simpler wiring** ‚Äì Fewer connections needed.  
‚úî **Scalable** ‚Äì Can support more SAS modes if mods add more options.  

#### **Cons of Rotary Encoder**
‚ùå **Slower selection** ‚Äì Must cycle through modes sequentially.  
‚ùå **Less immediate feedback** ‚Äì Only one active mode is visible.  

#### **Current Plan**
- **Re-evaluate after gameplay testing** to determine how frequently SAS mode switching is needed.
- **Hybrid approach possible**: A mix of **buttons for key SAS modes** and **encoder for full selection** could be an option if space allows.
- **Whichever is chosen, SAS mode must be displayed on the TFT for clarity.**

---

## **üìå Next Steps**
- **Refine internal wiring design (keystone vs. panel-mount connectors).**
- **Design a PCB layout for switch & encoder connections.**
- **Begin prototype assembly with Teensy 4.1 & PoE splitter.**
