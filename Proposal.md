# **Comprehensive Project Proposal: KSP & Space Simulation Controller**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This document outlines the design, features, and integration of a **custom-built space simulation controller** for **Kerbal Space Program (KSP)** and other space-based games. It includes UI/UX design, power considerations, microcontroller selection, feature implementation, and software integration with KSP mods.

## **ðŸ“œ Current Status**
The project is in the design and planning phase. **Hardware and software considerations have been mostly outlined**, with remaining decisions focused on finalizing integration details and optimizing component choices.

## **ðŸŽ› UI/UX Design**
### **Displays & Feedback System**
| **Display Type** | **Purpose** | **Notes** |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **TFT Display** | Main status display (altitude, velocity, SAS mode, camera mode, etc.) | Chosen for high-resolution graphical feedback |
| **OLED Display (Throttle)** | Shows throttle mode, current throttle percentage, and in-game throttle level | Compact & high-contrast |
| **OLED Display (Menu)** | Used for profile selection, calibration, settings | Menu navigation via rotary encoder |
| **RGB-Lit Buttons** | Indicate status of landing gear, brakes, RCS, SAS, stage lock | Provides immediate visual feedback |
| **RGB-Lit Rotary Encoders** | Used for SAS mode and camera mode selection | Blinks briefly when a mode is switched |

### **Controls**
| **Control** | **Function** | **Notes** |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **2x Joysticks (JH-D400X-R4)** | **Translation (X, Y, Z) & Rotation (Pitch, Yaw, Roll)** | One for translation, one for rotation |
| **Linear Potentiometer (Throttle)** | **Primary throttle control** | Motorized for self-calibration & auto-throttle |
| **Spring-Loaded Slider (Fore/Aft Translation)** | **Allows forward/backward movement in space** | Returns to center when released |
| **Rotary Encoder (Camera Mode)** | Cycles through camera views | Click toggles Free Camera |
| **Rotary Encoder (SAS Mode)** | Changes SAS mode | RGB-lit for mode indication |
| **20x Action Group Buttons** | Used for custom game functions | Split into 2x10 layout |
| **Precision Control Mode Button** | Enables fine-tuned movement (Caps Lock in KSP) | LED-lit for status indication |
| **Stage Button & Stage Lock Button (LED-lit)** | Executes staging and prevents accidental staging | Stage lock LED indicates status |

## **âš¡ Power System**
### **Primary Power: USB-C PD (5V, up to 3A)**
- Powers **Teensy 4.1, displays, joysticks, buttons, encoders**
- Uses **a high-efficiency voltage regulator** to prevent power fluctuations

### **Secondary Power Options:**
| **Power Source** | **Implementation Method** | **Status** |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Second USB-C (Power Only)** | Dedicated power input via USB-PD | **Optional footprint on PCB** |
| **PoE (Power over Ethernet)** | UCTRONICS PoE Splitter (5V 4A) | **Planned, splitter mounted internally** |
| **AC-DC PSU (IEC C7/C8)** | Internal power supply conversion | **Rejected (too complex for current build)** |

### **Power Stabilization Measures:**
- **Large capacitor (470ÂµF - 1000ÂµF) to smooth out motor power spikes**
- **Power monitoring circuit with menu-based logging**

## **ðŸ–¥ Microcontroller & Hardware Integration**
### **Main Microcontroller: Teensy 4.1**
- **Chosen for its high-speed processing & USB-HID support**
- Supports **Ethernet connectivity for mod integration**
- Handles all **sensor inputs, controls, display updates**

### **Additional Components:**
| **Component** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Motorized Potentiometer** | Allows automatic throttle calibration & autothrottle |
| **H-Bridge Motor Driver** | Controls motorized throttle |
| **Ethernet Kit for Teensy 4.1** | Adds network support for integration with KSP mods |
| **RGB Controllers** | For LED feedback systems |
| **Custom PCB (Planned)** | Houses main connections for switches, encoders, LEDs |

## **ðŸ“Œ Appendix: SAS Mode Selection Considerations**
### **Debating Between RGB Buttons vs. Rotary Encoder for SAS Mode**
Currently undecided between two options:
- **8 RGB-Lit Buttons (2x4 Layout)** for direct SAS mode switching.
- **RGB-Lit Rotary Encoder** for cycling through SAS modes sequentially.

## **ðŸ“Œ Appendix: Defining the Project Scope**
### **What Really Needs to Be in This Project?**
- Essential **flight controls, throttle, and key spacecraft toggles** (SAS, RCS, lights, landing gear, brakes).
- **Navigation displays** that enhance real-time decision-making without cluttering in-game UI.

### **What Could Be Handled with a Keyboard/Mouse?**
- **Map navigation and maneuver planning**
- **Menu navigation and advanced autopilot settings**
- **Fine-tuning of non-essential parameters**

### **What Data Display Could Be Offloaded to External Devices?**
