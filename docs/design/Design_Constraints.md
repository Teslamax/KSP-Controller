# üöß Design Constraints Summary

This document outlines technical limitations and required precautions when integrating components in the KSP Controller project.

---

## ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather
- ‚ùå Does not support Classic Bluetooth (BLE only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GPIO40‚Äì47 are reserved for the TFT display
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited ADC channels compared to ESP32
- ‚úÖ Native USB supports HID, CDC, Mass Storage via TinyUSB
- Internal flash storage has supports varying wear-leveling options

## Ethernet FeatherWing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses SPI ‚Äî requires dedicated CS (e.g. GPIO10)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shared SPI bus with SD card must be coordinated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May require external 3.3V regulator for stable Ethernet operation

## Adalogger FeatherWing
- ‚úÖ RTC uses I2C (DS3231)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shares I2C bus ‚Äî ensure address compatibility with other peripherals
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SD card also uses SPI ‚Äî must not share CS with Ethernet

## NeoKey 1x4
- ‚ö†Ô∏è I2C default address: 0x30
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3.3V or 5V power required
- ‚úÖ Fully compatible with STEMMA QT chain

## Cross-Component Considerations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SPI bus shared by multiple devices (SD, Ethernet, TFT)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è I2C bus shared by RTC and NeoKey (check addressing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Voltage drops and current draw may require capacitors or regulators
