## ðŸ“Œ Appendix: Microcontroller Platform Evolution

As the project evolves, different microcontroller platforms are being evaluated. While the **Teensy 4.1** was initially selected for its strong USB-HID and Ethernet support, recent experimentation with other boards (such as the **ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather**) may influence the final design.

| Stage           | Microcontroller              | Reasoning / Notes |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Initial Plan**    | **Teensy 4.1**                  | Chosen for native USB-HID, Ethernet support, high-speed processing, and strong Arduino library compatibility. |
| **Current Testing** | **ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather** | Being used for prototyping. Offers native USB, built-in TFT, wireless, and excellent library support. Evaluating its suitability as the final platform. |
| **Final Decision**  | *To Be Determined*             | Will be based on performance, integration complexity, and I/O requirements. Trade-offs between Teensy and ESP32 will be documented. |

> **Note:** Firmware development is proceeding on the ESP32-S3 board for now, but abstraction layers will help preserve compatibility with alternate hardware if needed.
