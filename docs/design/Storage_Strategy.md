# üì¶ Storage Strategy

This document outlines the various storage options available on the ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather and associated FeatherWings in your KSP Controller project. Each storage type is broken down by architecture, use case, performance, endurance, and ideal scenarios.

---

## üß† 1. Internal Flash Memory

- **Type**: QSPI Flash (4MB total)
- **API**: SPIFFS / LittleFS, Preferences, direct access
- **Typical Use**: Firmware, configuration data, occasional logs
- **Size**: ~1‚Äì2MB usable after firmware
- **Speed**: Fast (tens of MB/s)
- **Endurance**: ~100,000 writes per sector

**‚úÖ Best For**:
- Infrequently updated config
- Lightweight local files
- Static assets (images/fonts if not too large)

---

## üì• 2. EEPROM Emulation

- **Type**: Virtual EEPROM within flash sectors
- **API**: `Preferences.h` (recommended), `EEPROM.h` (legacy)
- **Typical Use**: Key/value settings, state tracking, HID profile IDs
- **Size**: ~4KB to 100KB
- **Speed**: Slower than RAM, fast enough for config
- **Endurance**: ~100,000 writes per sector

**‚úÖ Best For**:
- Persistent mode memory (last profile, boot flags)
- Small key/value data
- Reliable atomic reads/writes

---

## üíæ 3. microSD Card (Adalogger FeatherWing)

- **Type**: SPI-connected removable Flash
- **API**: `SD.h`, `SdFat.h`
- **Typical Use**: Log files, config backups, profile sets, large datasets
- **Size**: Up to **32GB FAT32** officially (larger with exFAT via `SdFat`)
- **Speed**: 2‚Äì10 MB/s typical (SPI limited)
- **Endurance**: 10,000‚Äì100,000 writes per block

**‚úÖ Best For**:
- Rotating logs / timestamped telemetry
- Full HID and user profile backups
- Assets and large config files

## üîç Recommendation Table

| Use Case                      | Recommended Storage        | Rationale |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Boot state, last mode        | EEPROM / Preferences       | Persistent, atomic |
| HID profile (current only)   | EEPROM                     | Fast, small |
| HID profiles (all saved)     | SD Card                    | Larger, versionable |
| Debug logs                   | SD Card                    | Frequent writes, removable |
| JSON config & backups        | SD Card                    | Flexible format, space |
| Images / fonts (UI)          | Flash or SD                | Flash for speed, SD for size |
| Firmware & binaries          | Flash                      | Only supported location |

## ‚úç Notes

- ‚ö† **Internal flash and EEPROM share erase blocks** ‚Äî frequent EEPROM writes can reduce flash lifespan.
- ‚ö° **microSD supports large log files** but requires proper write buffering and mount handling.
- üö´ **EEPROM is not suitable for large structured config or logs**.
