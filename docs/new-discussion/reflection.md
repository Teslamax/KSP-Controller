# Emotional Reflection & Project Philosophy

> “The anticipation is better than opening the present sometimes.”

## Notes

- The project isn't just about replacing controls — it's about *making the experience richer*
- Emotional investment is strong, even if KSP isn't currently played often
- It’s okay for this to be a hobby, not just a tool
- Building the panel is as valuable as using it

## Key Takeaway

> This project is powered by curiosity, not obligation.
> Every part you assemble, code you write, and idea you test is already a win.
