# Future Expansion Ideas

## Modular Keyboards

- Design custom PCBs with Choc V1 switches and RGB per-key lighting
- Connect over I2C using QT connectors
- Standardize to 1x4 or 2x2 modules for reuse and simplicity

## Breakout/Socketed Logic Boards

- Socket-mounted Feather + Ethernet + Logging FeatherWing
- Breakout connections for analog inputs (joysticks, throttle, etc.)
- Could evolve into a custom logic board (optional)

## Additional Components

- Add OLED or TFT displays for:
  - Contextual readouts
  - Status display (e.g., fuel, altitude, burn timer)
- Plan for input multiplexing or port expanders (e.g., MCP23017)
