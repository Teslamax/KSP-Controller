# Project Goals & Philosophy

- Build a compact, modular KSP control panel that integrates:
  - USB HID inputs (keyboard/gamepad style)
  - Simpit Revamped USB CDC feedback
  - RGB and motorized feedback (e.g., throttle)
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; only add controls that improve gameplay or immersion
- Respect emotional connection to KSP1 and the anticipation of building
- Enable mode-switching functionality with RGB and/or OLED/TFT displays

## Philosophical Approach

- Don't replace the keyboard/mouse unless there's clear benefit
- Prioritize controls that provide physical or contextual feedback better than screen-only UI
- Embrace anticipation and gradual build progress as part of the joy
