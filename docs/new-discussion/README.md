# KSP Controller Project (Post-SendCutSend Phase)

This repository documents the continued development of a custom Kerbal Space Program (KSP) control panel following the completion of initial laser-cut panels (ordered via SendCutSend). The goal is a modular, intelligent input device that integrates USB HID, Simpit Revamped telemetry, and context-aware feedback such as RGB lighting and motorized sliders.
