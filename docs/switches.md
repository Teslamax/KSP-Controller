### 🧠 Ergonomic Advice for Control Panels

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Key Profile** | DSA or low-profile for easy finger gliding and visibility |
| **Spacing** | Leave 1–2mm between switches for easy access |

| **Tactile Feedback** | Pair with tactile switches for finger feel over visuals |
| **Grip** | Consider light texture or soft top for finger control (anti-slip) |
